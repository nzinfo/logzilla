Known Bugs:
* Search filters (on the hosts grid) do not allow for negative searching (not or !)
* Can't set height on chart portlets to 100% so I have to set a hard number - this results in being unable to resize vertically.
* Time picker doesn't recognize a date flip (i.e. if you select from 23:00 to 01:00 the next day, the timepicker does not update the datepicker to the next day)
* Can't drag a scroll bar down - it tries to move the portal - you have to use the mouse scroll. 
* Doesn't work well with Internet Explorer


Wish List/To do's:

Add support for my.cnf to db_insert.pl: http://forum.logzilla.info/index.php/topic,261.0.html
add quick charts (dropdown menu for common charts such as Top 10 hosts, etc.)
add graph for mps per device?
Add detection for missing partitions (if server is shutdown when events are supposed to fire, the partitions aren't created)
Add nightly count verifications - ensure that the msg totals match what's in the db
Figure out a *fast* way to show total found rows for search results
