Known Bugs:
* Search filters (on the hosts grid) do not allow for negative searching (not or !)
* Can't set height on chart portlets to 100% so I have to set a hard number - this results in being unable to resize vertically.
* Can't drag a scroll bar down - it tries to move the portal - you have to use the mouse scroll. 


Wish List/To do's:

add quick charts (dropdown menu for common charts such as Top 10 hosts, etc.)
add graph for mps per device?
