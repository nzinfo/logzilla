Known Bugs:
* Search filters (on the hosts grid) do not allow for negative searching (not or !)
* Can't set height on chart portlets to 100% so I have to set a hard number - this results in being unable to resize vertically.
* Time picker doesn't recognize a date flip (i.e. if you select from 23:00 to 01:00 the next day, the timepicker does not update the datepicker to the next day)
* Can't drag a scroll bar down - it tries to move the portal - you have to use the mouse scroll. 


TODO:
* Create documentation for an Administration Guide.
