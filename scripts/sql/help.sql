Specifies the database column in which results should be sorted by.<br>\r\n<u>Examples</u>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Selecting \"Host\" would sort the results page (or Graph) by the Host (or IP) in either Ascending or Descending order.<br>\r\n<li>Selecting \"count\" would show the top (or bottom if you select descending from the search order) message counts when performing a regular search (assuming you have deduplication enabled). \r\n<li>In \"graph\" mode, the count column is used to group charts into Top X or Bottom X such as \"Top 10 hosts\" or \"Top 10 Mnemonics\"<br>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br>\r\n<li>Search Order - Specifies the order (Ascending or Descending) in which to display the results.<br>\r\n<li>Limit - Specifies the maximum results to return.<br>\r\n<u>Notes</u>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The maximum limit you can set here is 500 -  if you are unable to find what you are looking for within 500 results, chances are, you should modify your search criteria.<br>\r\n<li>In Graph mode, this option specifies the number of results to chart such as \"Top 10\" or \"Top 25\".<br>\r\n</ul>\r\n<li>Group By - This option is generally used for Graphs.<br>\r\n<u>Examples</u>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>To Generate Top 10 hosts, select \"Sort Order>count\" and \"Group By>Host\"\r\n<li>To Generate Top 10 Programs, select \"Sort Order>count\" and \"Group By>Program\"\r\n<li>Note that the default setting in LogZilla is to generate Top 10 Hosts when the \"Graph\" button is clicked without any search criteria entered.\r\n</ul>\r\n<li>Chart Type - Specifies the type of chart to generate when the \"Graph\" button is clicked<br>\r\n<u>Notes</u>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Pie charts are the only type of chart that can be drilled into (i.e. clicking on a pie piece will perform search on the data for that piece).\r\n</ul>\r\n<li>Auto Refresh -

this is only meant for displaying text results.\r\n<li>Be aware that the refresh is a \"live\" ajax call in the background - if you set the refresh rate to 1 second and a large limit of \"500\", then you will be making a query against the database every second for 500 rows.

world</pre>\r\n<li>operator OR:\r\n<pre class=\"programlisting\">hello | world</pre>\r\n<li>operator NOT:\r\n<pre class=\"programlisting\">\r\nhello -world\r\nhello !world\r\n</pre>\r\n<li>grouping:\r\n<pre class=\"programlisting\">( hello world )</pre></li></ul>\r\n<p>Here\'s an example query which uses all of these operators:\r\n<br></p>\r\n<pre class=\"programlisting\">( cat -dog ) | ( cat -mouse)</pre>\r\n<p><br>\r\nThere is always an implicit AND operator, so a \"hello world\" query actually means \"hello &amp; world\".<br>\r\nThe OR operator precedence is higher than AND, so \"looking for cat | dog | mouse\" means \"looking for ( cat | dog | mouse )\" and not \"(looking for cat) | dog | mouse\".\r\n<br>\r\nQueries like \"-dog\", which implicitly include all documents from the collection, can not be evaluated.\r\nThis is both for technical and performance reasons.<br>\r\nTechnically, Sphinx does not always keep a list of all IDs.<br>\r\nPerformance-wise, when the \r\ncollection is huge (ie. 10-100M documents), evaluating such queries could take \r\nvery long. </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Extended query syntax</b></u> </p>The following special operators and modifiers can be used when using the extended matchingmode:&gt;br&gt;\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>operator OR: <pre class=\"programlisting\">hello | world</pre>\r\n<li>operator NOT:<pre class=\"programlisting\"> hello -world hello !world</pre>\r\n<li>field search operator: <pre class=\"programlisting\">@title hello @body world</pre>\r\n<li>field position limit modifier (introduced in version 0.9.9-rc1): <pre class=\"programlisting\">@body[50] hello</pre>\r\n<li>multiple-field search operator: <pre class=\"programlisting\">@(title,body) hello world</pre>\r\n<li>all-field search operator: <pre class=\"programlisting\">@* hello</pre>\r\n<li>phrase search operator: <pre class=\"programlisting\">\"hello world\"</pre>\r\n<li>proximity search operator: <pre class=\"programlisting\">\"hello world\"~10</pre>\r\n<li>quorum matching operator: <pre class=\"programlisting\">\"the world is a wonderful place\"/3</pre>\r\n<li>strict order operator (aka operator \"before\"): <pre class=\"programlisting\">aaa &lt;&lt; bbb &lt;&lt; ccc</pre>\r\n<li>exact form modifier (introduced in version 0.9.9-rc1): <pre class=\"programlisting\">raining =cats and =dogs</pre>\r\n<li>field-start and field-end modifier (introduced in version 0.9.9-rc2): <pre class=\"programlisting\">^hello world$</pre></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Here\'s an example query that uses some of these operators: </p>\r\n<p>\r\n         \r\n<b>Extended matching mode: query example</b></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<pre class=\"programlisting\">\"hello world\" @title \"example program\"~5 @body python -(php|perl) @* code</pre>\r\nThe full meaning of this search is:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Find the words \'hello\' and \'world\' adjacently in any field in a document;\r\n<li>Additionally, the same document must also contain the words \'example\' and \'program\' in the title field, with up to, but not including, 10 words between the words in question; (E.g. \"example PHP program\" would be matched however \"example script to introduce outside data into the correct context for your program\" would not because two terms have 10 or more words between them)<li>Additionally, the same document must contain the word \'python\' in the body field, but not contain either \'php\' or \'perl\';\r\n<li>Additionally, the same document must contain the word \'code\' in any field.\r\n</li></ul>\r\nThere always is implicit AND operator, so \"hello world\" means that both \"hello\" and \"world\" must be present in matching document.\r\nThe OR operator precedence is higher than AND, so \"looking for cat | dog | mouse\" means \"looking for ( cat | dog | mouse )\" and \"(looking for cat) | dog | mouse\".\r\nField limit operator limits subsequent searching to a given field. Normally, query will fail with an error message if given field name does not exist in the searched index. However, that can be suppressed by specifying \"@@relaxed\" option at the very beginning of the query:\r\n<pre class=\"programlisting\">@@relaxed @nosuchfield my query</pre>\r\nThis can be helpful when searching through heterogeneous indexes with different schemas.\r\nField position limit, introduced in version 0.9.9-rc1, additionaly restricts the searching to first N position within given field (or fields). For example, \"@body[50] hello\" will <strong>not</strong> match the documents where the keyword \'hello\' occurs at position 51 and below in the body.\r\nProximity distance is specified in words, adjusted for word count, and\r\napplies to all words within quotes. For instance, \"cat dog mouse\"~5 query\r\nmeans that there must be less than 8-word span which contains all 3 words,\r\nie. \"CAT aaa bbb ccc DOG eee fff MOUSE\" document will <span class=\"emphasis\"><em>not</em></span> match this query, \r\nbecause this span is exactly 8 words long. \r\n<p></p><p>\r\nQuorum matching operator introduces a kind of fuzzy matching.\r\nIt will only match those documents that pass a given threshold of given words.\r\nThe example above (\"the world is a wonderful place\"/3) will match all documents\r\nthat have at least 3 of the 6 specified words.\r\n</p><p>\r\nStrict order operator (aka operator \"before\"), introduced in version 0.9.9-rc2,\r\nwill match the document only if its argument keywords occur in the document\r\nexactly in the query order. For instance, \"black &lt;&lt; cat\" query (without\r\nquotes) will match the document \"black and white cat\" but <span class=\"emphasis\"><em>not</em></span>\r\nthe \"that cat was black\" document. Order operator has the lowest priority.\r\nIt can be applied both to just keywords and more complex expressions,\r\nie. this is a valid query:\r\n</p><pre class=\"programlisting\">\r\n(bag of words) &lt;&lt; \"exact phrase\" &lt;&lt; red|green|blue\r\n</pre><p>\r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\nExact form keyword modifier, introduced in version 0.9.9-rc1, will match the document only if the keyword occurred\r\nin exactly the specified form. The default behaviour is to match the document\r\nif the stemmed keyword matches. For instance, \"runs\" query will match both\r\nthe document that contains \"runs\" <span class=\"emphasis\"><em>and</em></span> the document that\r\ncontains \"running\", because both forms stem to just \"run\" - while \"=runs\"\r\nquery will only match the first document. Exact form operator requires <i>index_exact_words</i> option to be enabled.\r\nThis is a modifier that affects the keyword and thus can be used within\r\noperators such as phrase, proximity, and
