         action and also the MAC limit is enforced for the VLAN.
         It means that the new address will not be learned in the VLAN
         and the traffic with new addresses will be flooded in the VLAN.
         The learning will be re-enabled in the VLAN if the number of
         MAC addresses falls below the limit.

         'warning' action and also the MAC limit is enforced for the
         VLAN but no flooding traffic for unknown unicast MAC address
         packets.  It means that the new addresses will not be learned
         in the VLAN and also the traffic with new addresses will not
         be flooded in the VLAN.  The learning will be re-enabled in
         the VLAN if the number of MAC addresses falls below the limit.

         shutdown : The notification will be generated as the 'warning'
         action and the system will move the corresponding VLAN to
         blocked state, no traffic in the VLAN.  The traffic will be
         re-enabled in the VLAN if the number of MAC addresses falls

         MAC limit function is to try to control the number of MAC
         addresses for each VLAN in the forwarding tables for a
         network device.  It is possible that one VLAN can exhaust
         all available MAC entries because of Denial-of-Service
         and cause users' traffic on the other VLANS flooded.  To
         prevent this situation, the MAC limit for each VLAN is
